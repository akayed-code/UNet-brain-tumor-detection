# UNet-brain-tumor-detection

The project focuses on the development and implementation of a robust brain tumor segmentation system using the U-Net architecture. Leveraging a diverse dataset of brain MRI scans, the goal is to enhance the precision and efficiency of tumor detection for improved medical diagnosis and treatment planning. The dataset, comprising both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, ensures a comprehensive analysis of various tumor types, sizes, and locations. Through meticulous preprocessing steps such as standardization, normalization, resizing, and data augmentation, the input data is optimized to facilitate effective training of the U-Net model.
